This repository contains the STM32CubeIDE project files for a test project.

The project uses the **STM32 Nucleo-L432KC** board with the STM32L432KCU6 microcontroller with Arm Cortex-M4 architecture.

The project also uses the **[MPU-9250](https://www.hotmcu.com/9dof-imu-module-with-mpu9250-p-172.html)** inertial measurement board, which is connected to the board via I2C.

The LCD display **EA DOGM204-A** is used to display the measurements and is connected to the board via SPI.
